### 2. Core Features Implementation

#### User Authentication
- Implement login, registration, and password reset forms
- Create protected routes with role-based access control
- Store JWT in localStorage or HTTP-only cookies
- Implement authentication state in Redux

#### Shift Calendar
- Calendar component with month, week, and day views
- Interactive shift selection through drag-and-drop
- Color-coded shift types for visual distinction
- Modal forms for shift creation and editing
- Admin-only edit capabilities with user suggestions queue

#### Shift Types
Implement the following shift types with designated working hours:
- **"M" (Morning shift)**: 06:48 AM to 03:00 PM
- **"A" (Afternoon shift)**: 02:48 PM to 11:00 PM
- **"N" (Night shift)**: 10:48 PM to 07:00 AM
- **"D" (Day shift)**: 09:00 AM to 06:00 PM
- **"PL" (Paid leave)**: Employee is on paid leave
- **"SL" (Sick Leave)**: Employee is on sick leave
- **"C" (Compensation)**: Taking compensation for overtime
- **"NH" (National holiday)**: Off for a national holiday

#### Reports Dashboard
- Implement data filtering by date range
- Create weekly and monthly report views with charts
- Display total hours worked per shift type
- Export reports as CSV or PDF

#### User Management (Admin)
- CRUD operations for user accounts
- Role assignment and permission management
- Bulk user import/export functionality

---

## Component Design

### 1. User Interface Components

#### Dashboard Layout
- Responsive sidebar navigation
- Header with user profile and notifications
- Main content area with breadcrumbs
- Mobile-friendly design with collapsible menu

#### Calendar Component
- Month/week/day view toggle
- Shift cards with color coding by type
- Popover for quick view of shift details
- Modal for detailed shift editing

#### Forms
- Standardized form components with validation
- Multi-step forms for complex operations
- Form state persistence for incomplete submissions

### 2. State Management

#### Redux Store Structure
```typescript
interface RootState {
  auth: {
    user: User | null;
    isAuthenticated: boolean;
    loading: boolean;
    error: string | null;
  };
  shifts: {
    entities: Record<string, Shift>;
    selectedDate: string | null;
    pendingApprovals: PendingShift[];
    loading: boolean;
    error: string | null;
  };
  users: {
    entities: Record<string, User>;
    loading: boolean;
    error: string | null;
  };
  ui: {
    sidebarOpen: boolean;
    activeModal: string | null;
    notifications: Notification[];
  };
}
```

#### API Slice Example
```typescript
export const apiSlice = createApi({
  reducerPath: 'api',
  baseQuery: fetchBaseQuery({ 
    baseUrl: '/api',
    prepareHeaders: (headers, { getState }) => {
      const token = (getState() as RootState).auth.token;
      if (token) {
        headers.set('authorization', `Bearer ${token}`);
      }
      return headers;
    },
  }),
  tagTypes: ['Shifts', 'Users', 'Reports'],
  endpoints: (builder) => ({
    // Endpoints will be defined here
  }),
});
```

## User Flows

### 1. Employee User Flow
- Login to the application
- View personal shift calendar
- Submit shift preferences and holiday requests
- Review shift schedule and receive notifications
- View personal reports on hours worked

### 2. Admin User Flow
- Manage user accounts (create, update, delete)
- Review and approve/reject shift requests
- Assign shifts to employees via calendar interface
- Generate and export employee reports
- Configure system settings and notifications

---

## Performance Considerations

- Implement virtualized lists for large datasets
- Use React.memo and useMemo for expensive calculations
- Optimize Redux selectors with createSelector
- Implement code splitting with React.lazy
- Use service workers for offline capabilities
- Implement proper error boundaries

---

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for utility functions and hooks
- Component tests for UI components
- Integration tests for user flows
- E2E tests for critical paths using Cypress
- Test coverage target: 80%+

---

## Deployment and CI/CD

- Setup GitHub Actions or similar CI pipeline
- Implement automated testing in CI
- Build optimization for production
- Deploy to Vercel, Netlify, or AWS
